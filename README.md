# British-Airway-Review-Analysis

This project demonstrates the development of a Python-based web scraping tool leveraging BeautifulSoup and requests to automate the extraction of structured data from the British Airlines website. 

The tool efficiently retrieves flight schedules and user reviews, reducing manual data preparation by 50%. Additionally, the project incorporates sentiment analysis using NLP techniques (pandas, nltk, scikit-learn) to classify user reviews as positive or negative with an accuracy of 82.4%. 

The analysis provides insights into customer satisfaction and pain points, offering actionable information for stakeholders. The workflow is documented with clean, reproducible code to ensure scalability and ease of future enhancements.
